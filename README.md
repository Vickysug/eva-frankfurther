## Project Brief

This project was one of several while on my internship with BIZGEES. The brief:

* Select a celebrity/famous person who was/is a refugee.

* Compile the information and background.

* Create a short 30 second - 2 minute game aimed at age group 18 -25.

* The game is to allow the player to learn about the refugee.

* Use AI to aid the creation.



## Technologies used

For the project the aim was to use AI, mainly Rosebud AI (https://play.rosebud.ai/home)

On the platform a developer can clone games created by other developers and change them for their own purpose. 

I chose to use a game called The Galena Uprising, Evolved from: Visual Novel AI Template, Created by: aikostvn.

Rosebud can generate AI images, I created some in Rosebud and some I searched for and edited in Photoshop. 
Rosebud also allows the AI chat to change code, I used this as well as coding myself. 

If I were to expand the game further, it would include another scene where the player could view artwork.
